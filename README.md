## What is this project? 
This project is a proof of concept for a smart home managing system which would monitor every facet of the house automatically, leading to a more environmentally and cost friendly home. 

It uses Automatic adjustments, graphing and speech recognition to give the user control but also allowing the home to manage itself.
